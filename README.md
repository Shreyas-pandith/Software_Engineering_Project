# Online Cricket Tournaments Management System



Managing score-card of whole tournament with each player's performance is very difficult task to do manually. So we are digitalizing the whole process though our software.

We have created a web application using Django framework (which is high level python framework ) . we have used html, css, javascript for front end design. Pycharm Ide is used for the developing purpose.
